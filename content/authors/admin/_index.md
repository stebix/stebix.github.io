## About Me

Hi there üëã! I am a PhD candidate at the Experimental Physics V of University of W√ºrzburg. For my research, I focus on the
**physics** and **signal processing** of **magnetic resonance (MR)** and **computed tomography (CT)** imaging.

The fusion of traditional physics with machine learning and differentiable programming to systematically improve the imaging process of
both modalities is of special interest.

As an avid coder and technologist with a strong focus on Python üêç, I love diving into emerging tools and frameworks
to solve complex problems, automate workflows, and build scalable applications.

In my free time, when I‚Äôm not coding or tinkering with tech, I enjoy sports (volleyball and running), competing in virtual worlds
and drinking a cup of coffee while contemplating life and things.
