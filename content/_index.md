        I am a PhD candidate in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging group (advised by 
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Jakob-2">Prof. Peter Jakob</a> and
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Blaimer">Dr. Martin Blaimer</a>
        at <a href="https://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ep5/">Experimental Physics V</a>.

        In my research I focus on the entire stack of imaging and vision problems.
        For the imaging methods I concern myself with magnetic resonance imaging (excite the spins in the object of interest and listen to the frequencies of the subsequent singing) and
        computed tomography (shoot the object with photons and measure what comes out the other end).
        For these two, it is often beneficial to optimize the imaging process and scanner device parameters
        with respect to certain target parameters.
        A certain target could e.g. maximal image sharpness for a certain budget of measurement time
        (typical for MRI) or a certain budget of radiation dose (typical for CT). 
        For this programmatic optimization, we often use differentiable programming, sometimes also called backpropagation or autodiff, to simulate the forward imaging process and
        getting gradients nearly free ðŸŽ‰
        Also, learning the characteristics of the scanner into a digital twin model via machine
        learning is of interest. 

        Another center of attention of my work is quantitative MRI. The default imaging process in MRI 
        is "qualitative". This means that the grey values of the image the typical radiologist or medical
        practitioner is looking at is incommensurable.
        Images created with other scanners, other scanner settings
        
        On top of simulating and improving the basal imaging process of MRI and CT,
        the subsequent processing and analysis of the - oftentimes threedimensional -
        image data is of interest.

        For this, methods of computer vision and deep learning is of special interest.
