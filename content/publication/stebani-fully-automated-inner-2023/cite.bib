 abstract = {Automated analysis of the inner ear anatomy in radiological data instead of time-consuming manual assessment is a worthwhile goal that could facilitate preoperative planning and clinical research. We propose a framework encompassing joint semantic segmentation of the inner ear and anatomical landmark detection of helicotrema, oval and round window. A fully automated pipeline with a single, dual-headed volumetric 3D U-Net was implemented, trained and evaluated using manually labeled in-house datasets from cadaveric specimen (\$\$N=43\$\$) and clinical practice (\$\$N=9\$\$). The model robustness was further evaluated on three independent open-source datasets (\$\$N = 23\\ + 7\\ + 17\$\$scans) consisting of cadaveric specimen scans. For the in-house datasets, Dice scores of \$\$\text\0.97 and 0.94\\$\$, intersection-over-union scores of \$\$\text\0.94 and 0.89\\$\$and average Hausdorff distances of \$\$0.065\\\$\$and \$\$0.14\\\$\$voxel units were achieved. The landmark localization task was performed automatically with an average localization error of \$\$\text\3.3 and 5.2\\$\$voxel units. A robust, albeit reduced performance could be attained for the catalogue of three open-source datasets. Results of the ablation studies with 43 mono-parametric variations of the basal architecture and training protocol provided task-optimal parameters for both categories. Ablation studies against single-task variants of the basal architecture showed a clear performance benefit of coupling landmark localization with segmentation and a dataset-dependent performance impact on segmentation ability.},
