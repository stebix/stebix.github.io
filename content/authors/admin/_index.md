## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the Experimental Physics V of University of Würzburg. For my research, I focus on the
**physics** and **signal processing** of **magnetic resonance (MR)** and **computed tomography (CT)** imaging.

The usage of machine learning and differentiable programming to systematically improve the imaging process of
both modalities is of special interest.

In addition to optimization of imaging methods, I am interested in applying machine intelligence via deep learning
onto (imaging) data to enable fully automated and scalable evaluation pipelines.

In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, running and competing in virtual worlds.
