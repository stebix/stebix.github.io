abstract: In order to treat degenerative diseases, the importance of advanced therapy
  medicinal products has increased in recent years. The newly developed treatment
  strategies require a rethinking of the appropriate analytical methods. Current standards
  are missing the complete and sterile analysis of the product of interest to make
  the drug manufacturing effort worthwhile. They only consider partial areas of the
  sample or product while also irreversibly damaging the investigated specimen. Two-dimensional
  T1 / T2 MR relaxometry meets these requirements and is therefore a promising in-process
  control during the manufacturing and classification process of cell-based treatments.
  In this study a tabletop MR scanner was used to perform two-dimensional MR relaxometry.
  Throughput was increased by developing an automation platform based on a low-cost
  robotic arm, resulting in the acquisition of a large dataset of cell-based measurements.
  Two-dimensional inverse Laplace transformation was used for post-processing, followed
  by data classification performed with support vector machines (SVM) as well as optimized
  artificial neural networks (ANN). The trained networks were able to distinguish
  non-differentiated from differentiated MSCs with a prediction accuracy of 85%. To
  increase versatility, an ANN was trained on 354 independent, biological replicates
  distributed across ten different cell lines, resulting in a prediction accuracy
  of up to 98% depending on data composition. The present study provides a proof of
  principle for the application of T1 / T2 relaxometry as a non-destructive cell classification
  method. It does not require labeling of cells and can perform whole mount analysis
  of each sample. Since all measurements can be performed under sterile conditions,
  it can be used as an in-process control for cellular differentiation. This distinguishes
  it from other characterization techniques, as most are destructive or require some
  type of cell labeling. These advantages highlight the technique’s potential for
  preclinical screening of patient-specific cell-based transplants and drugs.
